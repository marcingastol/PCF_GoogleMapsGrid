# PCF - Google Maps Grid
A PCF control to render a view of records on Google Maps using the location information (lat/long) againt each record.

## Features
- The control uses the columns in the view to display an information window when a location marker is clicked.
- The information window also includes a configurable title that will navigate the user to the respective record
- The control also requests your current location to display the map in the correct area. Location data is not transmitted externally. You can choose to deny this permission and the map will load at lat/long 0,0.

**NOTE:** You will need to provide a Google Maps API Key.
